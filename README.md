# GraphqlHappyCompany

Simple usage of [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/) with [GraphQL](https://aws.amazon.com/graphql/), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/).

## Disclaimer

I'm not Angular master, I've never develop in Angular. You don't find here best practices, but just working code.

## Requiremants

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Run

1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
1. Run `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli` to install the Amplify Command Line Interface (CLI).
    1. Run `amplify status` to check your Amplify status.
    1. Run `amplify init` in the root of your app directory to initialize your project with Amplify.
    1. Rename `src\aws-exports.js` file to `src\aws-exports.ts`.
    1. (optionally) Run `amplify status` to check your Amplify status.
    1. (optionally) Run `amplify push` to create cloud resources.
1. Run `ng serve`, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Notes

1. I modified manually one autogenerated file (`src\app\API.service.ts`) to get data that I expected. I could use `--max-depth` amplify parameter, but then I will get more data for all queries, I need it only for one particular query.

1. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.1.
